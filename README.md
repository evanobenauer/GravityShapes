# GravitySquares
Gravity Squares is a simple applet gravity simulator for a bunch of little, random squares

This app is built using GlowUI and GlowLib

The app uses a true physics engine to calculate the gravity for each individual object on screen.
The simulation is fun to look and and mess around with. (Even try dragging the squares!)
