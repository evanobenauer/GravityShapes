# GravityShapes

![title](img/Title.gif.gif)

Gravity Shapes is a mini applet developed ing Java using my AppNexus library for UI creation.
This application created PhysicsObjects that orbit together with respect to Newtonian physics concepts such as:
- Kinematics
- Rotational Kinematics
- Forces/Torques
- Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation
- Conservation of Momentum
  
# Universal Options

# Modes
Gravity Shapes currently offers 3 modes
- Bounce Collision Mode
  - Objects bounce off of one another using Conservaton of Momentum
- Merge Collision Mode
  - Objects combine when collided using Conservation of Momentum and Rotational Motion
- Electronics Mode
  - Currently Unimplemented
